He’s not here~, he’s not here~! Over here too, he’s not here~!</p><p>Peekaboo~! Who’s a cute little baby, huuuh? (1)  ARGHHH! At this rate, I’m gonna rack up such an overwhelming grudge that I won’t be able to attain Nirvana (2), and remain as a vengeful spirit in this world after I dieee!</p><p>(<i>… …Mike-chan-senpai, you idiooot!</i></p><p><i>You’re always showing up and butting in when no one had called for youーever!ーbut now that I’m looking for you, you’re nowhere to be found! It makes me so hopping mad!</i></p><p><i>But then, Mike-chan-senpai will be graduating this year too, so I’m sure he’s probably busy with a whole buncha things.</i></p><p><i>What is this ‘Repayment Festival’ (3) all about? It seems like we’re gonna do something like the Chocolat Fest (4) we had the other day?</i></p><p><i>But, I’ve also heard it’s a graduation ceremony-like event where kouhais like us say “Thank you” to the senpais of our units, huh~?  </i></p><p><i>That’s right! The underclassmen will plan and carry out everything, showing our growth and expressing our gratitude to the upperclassmen at the same time! That’s how we repay them back for all the favours given to us; I heard all about it from Tomo-chan!</i></p><p><i>In our case, we, the first-year students prepared for this event all by ourselves, with the goal of sending Ni~chan off with a whole lotta thanks and joy! We’re gonna make him so happy!</i></p><p><i>Uuu… Since Ni~chan is going to college, we won’t be able to see each other as often from now on…</i></p><p><i>Thatーthat’s gonna be very lonely, butー</i></p><p><i>ーI’m not gonna whine about being lonely or not liking it at all. I’m gonna help Ni~chan move forward to a new stage with peace of mind and an encouraging push on his back!</i></p><p><i>It’ll be like thumping the rump of a racehorse before it starts to run! </i></p><p><i>Ah~ I’d love to compete with a racehorse on the track one day… … ♪ )</i></p><p>… … No! I’d much rather race against Mike-chan-senpai than any racehorse right now!</p><p>After all, I’ve not beaten Mike-chan-senpai in a ‘serious showdown’ yet, not even once!</p><p>And when he throws the match to me, he does it in <i>such</i> an obvious way, it <i>only</i> annoys me even more!</p><p><i>( Mike-chan-senpai just doesn’t see me as someone he’s gotta go all out against. He treats me like a child, and not as a serious rival at all…</i></p><p><i>However! I’ve always gone all out as an athlete myself, so I won’t accept being treated like that!</i></p><p><i>Before Mike-chan-senpai graduates, I’m gonna have a serious race against him and win! Even if it’s only once! If we could do that, it would be like our version of the Repayment Fest…</i></p><p><i>When Mike-chan-senpai, the Captain of the Track and Field Club, witnesses how much I’ve grown, he’ll definitely feel at ease when he leaves us to enter society!</i></p><p><i>Well, the Track and Field Club does have Ado-chan-senpai as a sensible and capable second-year, so it’s possible he already feels at ease about us, huh!</i></p><p><i>However, I’m part of the Track and Field Club, too! I want to repay Mike-chan-senpai for being my Captain!</i></p><p><i>Mike-chan-senpai’s unit, MaM, has no members other than Mike-chan-senpai himself, that’s why it’s called a ‘solo unit’… …</i></p><p><i>As a unit, and as an idol, there are no kouhais who will perform any Repayment to him. </i></p><p><i>Fufu! If that’s the case, then we of the Track and Field Club will be the ones to do so! I owe Mike-chan-senpai a lot for all the care he has shown me as part of the Track and Field Clubー</i></p><p><i>ーUgh! Even though it’s not always that way! It feels like he’s been constantly neglecting me too! </i></p><p><i>Even so! We might only be bound by the slightest of connections to each other, but I’m still going to express my gratitude and say “Thank you!” to Mike-chan-senpai!</i></p><p><i>If it will let him graduate happy and relieved, with a smile on his face, I’ll do it! It would be ridiculous if Mike-chan-senpai were the only one who got left out! </i></p><p><i>I want to tell him this at the very least! Thank you for being with me! Thank you for participating in all my favourite athletic activities together with me!</i></p><p><i>In order to do that, I need to find Mike-chan-senpai first, though. </i></p><p><i>Where in the world could that person be? I’ve been looking all over for him, but he’s nowhere to be found! Could it be that he’s gone away overseas again? If that’s the case, there’s nothing I can do about it, huh? )</i></p><p>… … … … Urrrm?</p><p>What’s that…, over there… There’s someone who looks a lot like Mike-chan-senpai?</p><blockquote><p>=== A few minutes later. ===</p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width="2048" data-orig-height="1430" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/9e7a2a1ab719b037cf4b292141e9d7a9/d35ae9b2552ecf2d-e0/s1280x1920/3ca1d41f1c788d9d4fa2844341f9941ad0cb1e44.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="2048" data-orig-height="1430" data-media-key="9e7a2a1ab719b037cf4b292141e9d7a9:d35ae9b2552ecf2d-e0" width="1280" height="894" /></figure><p><b> Mitsuru</b>: ーーFwah~?</p><p>Oh, wo~w… … I’ve ended up in a strange place, huh?</p><p>What is this place?

I’m always afraid I’ll do something clumsy, like falling on or trampling on<b> </b>such beautiful and fragile things like these flowers! </p><p>I get so mad because I end up doing those kinda things all the time… … Hmmm?</p><p>Why is there light shining in from there? Isn’t it strange for this place to be so brightly lit even though it’s underground… … …?</p><p>Did someone let the sunlight in, for the sake of letting these flowers grow so vibrantly?</p><p>One can open up the ceiling and install glass there to let the light inーI’ve heard Hajime-chan, who loves growing plants, say something like that before!</p><p>Is this supposed to be a place like that? What was it called again? A greenhouse? It’s not the same, though? </p><p><i>( Ah! Rather than worrying about that, I need to look for Mike-chan-senpai!

And ‘<i>bero-bero-ba’</i> is a nonsensical word used to soothe an infant… And you say it while sticking out your tongue while making a pleasant expression…<br /><br />So, I’m laughing because it’s like Mitsuru is imagining Madara playing peekaboo games with him, making silly faces and waggling his tongue (being a Mama! <strike>Or Papa</strike>) trying to pacify him at that moment, but it only had the opposite effect of sending Mitsuru’s blood pressure through the roof.<br /><br /></li><li>Nirvana: Japanese Buddhism believes in the reincarnation of the soul after death. However, a soul which has a grudge or unfinished business in the human world will be unable to attain enlightenment / Nirvana to finish the cycle. Thus, the spirit / ghost / revenant haunts the human world until the business is resolved, upon which the grudge is cleansed and the soul can rise to heaven so that the cycle can continue. <br /><br /></li><li>Repayment Fest: Repayment Fest, or 返礼祭, is an event in Yumenosaki, where the first and second year unit members send off their graduating third-year seniors with a performance. It also involves choosing a new leader to succeed the unit. Repayment Fest takes place around White Day (March 14th) as the seniors graduate from schools in Japan and start a new school year in April. The events were held in the game once a year from 2016 - 2019 (meaning one year in the game lasted 4 years in the real world). The game moved forward to (!!) era in 2020 and everyone finally grew older by a year in the game.<br /><br />There are four Repayment Fest stories in Basic, and they are all supposed to have taken place concurrently in the game.  <br />1) Clash! Recollect–A Festival of Giving Back (2Wink / UNDEAD / Keito + Kuro) March 2016<br />2) Baton Pass! Repayment Festival of Tears and Bonds (Ryuuseitai) March 2017 (Madara is mentioned in passing in this story)<br />3) <a href="https://humancomedy.tumblr.com/">Moment＊The Repayment Festival of Moving Forward Toward the Future (Ra*bits / Valkyrie)</a> March 2018<br />4) Requiem＊Sword of Oaths and the Repayment Festival (Knights) Mar 2019<br />The YNS units who didn’t participate in the Repayment Fest were Trickstar (because all members were Year 2s; no one was graduating) and MaM, because as a solo unit, Madara had no juniors. Madara mentioned being free and not having to make any arrangements in the event during the RST / Ra*bits / MaM Halloween event in October 2017. <br />But in 2022… … <br /><br /></li><li><a href="https://href.li/?https://ensemble-stars.fandom.com/wiki/Chocolat_Fes">ChocolateFest</a>: (!) era Valentine’s Day event<br /><br /></li><li>If you spot any mistakes, please PM me!</li></ol></div>
